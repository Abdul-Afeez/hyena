<p>"It's past time," Aubrey Hruby, an African Investment Advisor, tweeted in favor of calls for an end to <strong>police</strong> violence in Nigeria.</p>

<p>"Last year, I brought VC investors to Nigeria from Egypt, and they were completely shaken down and robbed by the <strong>police</strong> as they were leaving the country after an amazing week of meeting with stellar Nigerian entrepreneurs #EndSARS," Hruby concluded, describing her encounter with the rogue <strong>police</strong> unit, Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS).</p>

<p>Many of the <strong>people</strong> who reacted to her account expressed concern that the occurrence would reduce investment in Nigeria's IT sector. The rise of the services industry, which is the backbone of the Nigerian economy, has been fueled by the technology sub-sector.</p>

<p>Imagine if additional investors who contribute the capital essential to fund the sector's expansion were subjected to SARS-style persecution.</p>

<p>Foreign investors may be pursued by the police.</p>

<p>The EndSARS situation, as well as previous <strong>policy</strong> blunders, may cause investors to be wary of Nigeria. In 2019, foreign investors provided $75 million to the technology sector. According to figures from the Central Bank of Nigeria, this is a 703 percent increase over the $9 million invested in 2018.</p>

<p>Perhaps the agreement that saw Stripe purchase Nigerian payments company Paystack would not have happened if Stripe CEO Patrick Collison had been subjected to <strong>police</strong> <strong>harassment</strong> in Nigeria. Perhaps it would have. However, the security <strong>threat</strong> causes uncertainty, which inhibits Nigerian youth's great talent. SARS horror stories abound among Nigerian technology employees.</p>

<p>"Investors who overlook Nigeria now have to ask themselves: What do I know that Patrick Collison doesn't?" remarked Paul Graham, co-founder of the US-based startup <strong>incubator</strong> Y Combinator, following the announcement of the Paystack takeover transaction.</p>

<p>People in the comments expressed the idea that, in the absence of weak administration, Nigeria might become Africa's focus of foreign investment.</p>

<p>Nigeria, which now ranks 131 out of 190 nations in terms of ease of doing business, has to take concrete actions to improve its attractiveness to investors.</p>

<p>Policymakers should be worried about this.</p>

<p>Regulators, politicians, and <strong>political</strong> leaders aren't doing enough to protect this fast-growing business, which is shocking.</p>

<p>From Q1 2018 to Q4 2019, the technology sector grew at the second-fastest rate, after only transportation and storage. It contributed almost 13% to the economy. This is around 10 times the transportation and storage sub-input. sector's</p>

<p>Over the previous ten years, Nigeria's technology sector has increased its real GDP. After Nigeria entered a recession in 2016, it fell somewhat in 2017.</p>

<p>It also contributes more to GDP than the oil and gas sector, which is the country's main source of revenue. Government measures that favor the technology sector may result in an increase in GDP.</p>

<p>Over $1 billion might be lost in the technology sector.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 epidemic has inflicted a blow to Nigeria's economy, potentially slowing the technology sector's growth.</p>

<p>The national economic production in Q2 2020 dropped by 6.1 percent. After the recent social turmoil clouded Nigeria's economy, a financial services firm, Cordros Capital, reduced its GDP <strong>growth</strong> prediction. It predicted that the economy would shrink by 6.91 percent in Q4 2020 and 4.15 percent for the entire year 2020.</p>

<p>Even if that proportion appears tiny, it translates to a loss of $12.9 billion (6.91 percent of Nigeria's GDP in 2019). Technically, the country would be in a downturn (if Q3 2020 national economic output <strong>growth</strong> is also negative).</p>

<p>Between 2010 and 2019, there was a 93 percent positive association between the real GDP of the technology <strong>industry</strong> and the overall economy. To put it another way, they both go in the same direction. The IT industry's GDP could fall to $24.6 billion this year, down from $25.6 billion last year. However, the pandemic isn't the only issue confronting Nigeria's IT sector.</p>

<p>Unfavorable <strong>policy</strong> decisions, such as Lagos' ban on bike-hailing and other anti-innovation statements, pose a <strong>threat</strong> to Nigeria's technology economy, which is mostly driven by the country's youth. Rogue <strong>police</strong> officers constitute a security danger, which is becoming more prevalent. These issues will further reduce the sector's pie and, as a result, the Nigerian economy.</p>
