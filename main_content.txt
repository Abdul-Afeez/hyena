<p>Hello there,</p>

<p>Here's what we're talking about today:</p>

<li>Series A by ANKA</li>

<li>Africa has been hit by cyber-attacks.</li>

<h3>ANKA has raised $6.2 million in its Series A funding round.</h3>

<p>ANKA, an Ivorian eCommerce firm, has raised $6.2 million in a pre-Series A investment. Alibaba's Executive Vice Chairman, Joe Tsai, BESTSELLER Foundation, VestedWorld, Enigmo, Groupe Prunay, and Rising Tide Africa all participated in the round, which was led by Investisseurs & Partenaires.</p>

<p>The company has also renamed in addition to the investment announcement. The startup, which was previously known as Afrikrea, will now be known as ANKA. It will use the new funding to focus on expanding the mobile infrastructure of ANKA's eCommerce SaaS, as well as hiring more personnel and product development.</p>

<p>"As our vision and clients' needs have outgrown the primary purpose of the Afrikrea marketplace, operating under ANKA provides a more holistic explanation of our objective as a pan-African firm," said Moulaye Taboure, CEO and Co-founder of ANKA.</p>

<p>While Africa has a plethora of eCommerce enterprises, just a few allow Africans to sell to customers outside of the continent. In 2016, ANKA was created to address that void. The firm has apparently completed over $35 million in transactions since its debut, with women accounting for over 80% of its retailers.</p>

<h3>Africa has been hit by cyber-attacks.</h3>

<p>If you're anything like me, you don't get too worked up over the possibility of a cyberattack. Despite this, organizations all around the world are subjected to countless <strong>cyberattacks</strong> on a daily basis.</p>

<p>According to Check Point Research, a cybersecurity organization, the fourth quarter of 2021 saw an astonishing pace of cyberattacks, with about 925 <strong>cyberattacks</strong> per week. The number of <strong>cyberattacks</strong> every week grew by 50% in 2021 compared to 2020, according to their data.</p>

<p>The education/research sector was the target of the most attacks, followed by government/military. Africa had the highest number of attacks of all the regions surveyed, with 1353 attacks each week on African organizations.</p>

<p>Cybersecurity threats are nothing new in Africa. Following an attack on its digital infrastructure in June 2020, Life Healthcare Group, a private hospital operator in South Africa, was forced to convert to manual processes. In Uganda's telecoms and financial sectors, a wave of <strong>cyberattacks</strong> in October 2020 resulted in the theft of an estimated $3.2 million.</p>
