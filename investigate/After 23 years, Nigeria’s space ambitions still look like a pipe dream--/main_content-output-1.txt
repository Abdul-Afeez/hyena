A fresh start?
In the short term, the government is in charge of all investments made in the research and development of space technology.
In the medium term, the government will put into action a plan to partially commercialize the products and services that NASRDA produced as part of the short-term plan for economic development.
On the long term, the public sector and private sector work together in collaboration with the government to carry out the public-private partnership framework for the space program.

If you are a fan of Avatar: The Last Airbender like I am, you are undoubtedly looking forward to seeing the phrase "Long ago, the four nations..."
Everything will fall into place, my good friend. However, I ask that you pay close attention.
Hurricane Katrina, a historically significant storm, made landfall in New Orleans on August 29, 2005. New Orleans is located along the border between Louisiana and Mississippi. That was the final time that many people had seen their homes, and more than a thousand people lost their lives.
Boxing Day in the year 2004 was the date of the world's third-largest earthquake, which led to the occurrence of the Asian Tsunami, which is considered to be one of the greatest natural catastrophes. A total of 227,898 individuals are thought to have lost their lives in 14 nations along the coast, including India, Indonesia, and Thailand.
Why make a reference to Avatar, and what exactly does that entail in this context? The initial plan was to provide a list of the various natural catastrophes that can occur, but after further consideration, I realized that all four factors play an important part in the unfolding of these events. Earth, which includes the entire world, Water, which includes earthquakes and tsunamis, Air, which includes tornadoes and earthquakes, and Fire, which includes the aftermath.
But I digress.
The primary focus of this article is on identifying a factor that is shared by both of the catastrophes. But before we get into that, why even bother bringing up the catastrophes in the first place? Where is the link between the two?
In both instances, the NigeriaSat-1 satellite, which was constructed in 2003 by Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL) in the United Kingdom, was the first satellite to deliver photographs of the eastern coast of the United States following Hurricane Katrina. In addition to this, it gave humanitarian workers with photographs that were extremely helpful after the tsunami that struck Asia.
West Africa, Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay were all affected by floods in the years leading up to NigeriaSat-1's retirement in 2014 as a part of the Disaster Monitoring Constellation. Additionally, it has been utilized in a variety of mapping projects, including those concerning the Amazon and the coastline regions of Vietnam.
Other satellites are owned by Nigeria, and they have been put to use in a variety of contexts; but, before we get into that, let's take a step or two back.
The history of Nigeria in space travel is a lengthy and eventful one. NASA Tracking Station 5 was the first satellite earth station to be created in Nigeria and was constructed in Kano in 1961 by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to monitor the Gemini and Apollo space missions. Few people are aware of this fact, and even fewer people remember it.
It is interesting to note that the station was shut down in 1963, well in advance of the completion of both missions in 1966 and 1972, respectively.
It wasn't until 1976, during an ECOWAS meeting that was held in Addis Ababa, that Nigeria first declared its aspirations to become a space power. However, it took the country another 23 years to establish a space agency. As a result of the recommendation made by a committee of nine industry professionals that was appointed by the National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure, the National Space Research and Development Agency (NASRDA) was officially established in May of 1999. ( NASENI).
Note: The Nigerian federal government established NASENI in 1992 based on the recommendations of the White Paper Committee on the 1991 Report of a 150-member National Committee on Engineering Infrastructure. This committee included scientists, engineers, administrators, federal and state civil servants, economists, lawyers, bankers, and industrialists. NASENI was founded on these recommendations.
The mission of the National Aeronautics and Space Research and Growth Agency (NASRDA) is to "vigorously pursue the attainment of space capabilities as an essential tool for the socioeconomic development and the enhancement of the quality of life of Nigerians."
The Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation is responsible for overseeing the agency at this time.
At the moment, NASRDA is in charge of directing Nigeria's efforts in the space program. In addition, the National Space Policy (NSP) was authorized in the year 2000, and in 2005, a road map for its implementation that would last for the next 25 years was endorsed. However, we will discuss those in a moment.
The Nigerian Communications Satellite (NIGCOMSAT) Limited was established in 2006 as a state-owned company with the responsibility of managing and operating Nigeria's communication satellites under the direction of the Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy.
In its 15 years of existence, the company has yet to produce a profit. It is a limited liability enterprise that does not have an establishing Act, and it has been the focus of criticism ever since it recently claimed that it will buy two new satellites in the years 2023 and 2025.
In addition to that, it operates through a wholly owned subsidiary known as GeoApps Plus Limited, which is tasked with handling the commercialization of satellite imagery obtained from Nigeria's earth observation satellites. On its Facebook page, the company states that it offers training in Geographic Information System and Remote Sensing to a variety of clients, including ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs), as well as the military.
After the Defense Space Administration Act was signed into law in 2017, and in accordance with the recommendations of the National Space Policy, the Defense Space Administration (DSA) was officially commissioned to acquire further space scientific technology to assist the armed forces.
The Defense Space Agency (DSA), which was renamed to its current moniker on October 9, 2014, was initially founded on that date. The DSA is now training a number of engineers in conjunction with NIGCOMSAT and NASRDA.
However, there is still a great deal to examine with the NSP, and we will be doing so very soon.

As we learned in 2018, much like the space programs of the majority of other nations, Nigeria's space program is cloaked in secret.
After conducting an exhaustive search on LinkedIn, I was able to locate the profile of Dr. Halilu Ahmad Shaba, Director General of the NASRDA, who kindly consented to speak with me for this piece.
When I asked him what kinds of policies we may anticipate during his tenure, he didn't tell me but he did say that the NSP will definitely be reviewed even though he didn't answer my question. An assignment that would be carried out in conjunction with the revision of the existing road map that has been authorized by President Muhammadu Buhari.
However, while we wait for the review, we may look at the policy as it currently stands.
The National Strategic Plan is a document consisting of ten chapters that outlines a variety of goals, including defense and law enforcement, prediction of natural disasters, observation of earth, alleviation of poverty, promotion of international cooperation, and the establishment of research centers.
In addition to this, it offers Nigeria's model for the space economy, which is a public-private collaboration involving plans for the short, the medium, and the long term.
In order to do this, the roadmap includes the following benchmarks:

In terms of carrying out the plan, Nigeria has achieved some level of success. Earlier, we discussed the NigeriaSat-1 satellite. In addition, NASRDA has enabled the training of engineers in the construction of EO satellites. The NigeriaSat-X satellite was entirely constructed by Nigerians, and it was launched with the Nigeria-Sat-2 satellite, which was launched by the SSTL in 2011.
Both the NigeriaSat-1 and the NigeriaSat-X satellites have a lifespan of seven years and were expected to deorbit in 2018. However, after four years, both are still operating by "grace," as Shaba described it, and according to the advice of an expert I consulted, Nigeria is obtaining a greater return on its investment.
The EduSat-1 was a product of a partnership between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASRADA) and the Federal University of Technology Akure (FUTA) in Ondo State, Nigeria. It was constructed in Nigeria and launched from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in 2017, but it was decommissioned in 2019.
Concerning astronauts, you may recall that Nigeria's current Minister of Science, Technology, and Innovation, Ogbonnaya Onu, told Nigerians in March 2016 that the country would send an astronaut into space on or before the year 2030. You may also recall that this prediction was made by Minister Onu. Prior to that time, a hoax email that said a Nigerian astronaut was lost in orbit had gone around, which prompted a variety of responses from people. On the other hand, Shaba has verified that this benchmark has not yet been accomplished.
It does not appear that Nigeria will achieve its goal of launching into space before the year 2030. As of the year 2021, 14 African nations have successfully launched a total of 44 satellites; however, none of these launches originated from an African launch site.
As of the year 2019, the Centre for Space Transport and Propulsion (CSTP), located in Epe, Lagos State, has successfully carried out three separate launches of experimental rockets.
But because Nigeria's space program is kept under wraps, all we know about its previous milestone is that it reached an altitude of 10 kilometers before 2019. Despite this, Shaba claims that it has gotten worse since then.
" Due to the fact that it may also be put to use for practical reasons, we have argued that we are not going to make it public knowledge. Therefore, we decided to close it to the public and only give a few skeletal speeches regarding that matter.
Communication satellites are an essential component of the field of space technology. Even though they might not give Internet speeds that are as fast as those provided by undersea cables or be as dependable, in a nation like Nigeria where broadband penetration is as low as 41 percent, even the little thing that can be done to increase connectivity is beneficial.
Satellites, on the other hand, only account for a 0.2 percent share of Nigeria's Internet connectivity at the moment.
After the successful launch of the NigeriaSat-1 in 2004, the government awarded a contract to the state-owned China Great Wall Industry Corporation Limited (CGWIC) to construct the communication satellite NigComSat-1.
NigComSat-1 was deployed into space in 2007, but the satellite had to be turned off in 2008 because of an issue with its solar array, which meant that it did not have sufficient power. The Nigerian government was fortunate enough to have a failsafe insurance coverage, which allowed them to contract CGWIC once more for the construction of the NigComSat-1R.
NIGCOMSAT, much like it had done with its forerunner, was in charge of managing the NigComat-1R satellite when it was launched in 2011 with a lifespan of 15 years. Due to the fact that it was a replacement, the NigComSat-2 had the same exact characteristics as the NigComSat-1.
In 2018, Reuters claimed that Nigeria had once again agreed to a deal with the CGWIC for two communication satellites that were to be ready by the years 2020 and 2021 and that the deal was worth a total of $550 million. However, there is no information that can be relied on to determine whether or not the deal was finalized. Particularly after the attention of the world was diverted to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Shaba, on the other hand, believes that this move and the one that NIGCOMSAT is currently making to contract new satellites are unproductive in comparison to what NASRDA has previously accomplished in terms of teaching engineers and manufacturing satellites.
It is impossible to have two separate manufacturing agencies for satellites. And since NIGCOMSAT is a communications limited, we recommended that it limit itself to transpondence.
A little aside: transpondence refers to the act of receiving, transmitting, or both receiving and sending messages or information through transponders or any one of a variety of radio transmission devices.
According to Temidayo Onisosun, founder of Space in Africa, a media, analytics, and consultancy organization focused on the space and satellite industry in Africa, the space ecosystem may be broken down into two categories: upstream and downstream.
Similar to upstream companies in the oil and gas sector, space startups focus on exploration and drilling as their primary activities. In the context of the space ecosystem, this may refer to the launch of rockets or satellites, or it may refer to space missions.
A business that operates further downstream would place a greater emphasis on areas such as remote sensing and communication, amongst other things. At the moment, the government of Nigeria is in charge of the majority of Nigeria's space ecosystem, particularly the upstream activities.
In 2010, the NASRDA Act was passed, which established the National Space Council (NSC) as the regulator. This was done to help the government achieve its aim of large-scale commercialization by the year 2030. According to the Act, the NSC has the authority to provide licenses for space activities in Nigeria. However, it does not include any provisions for private partnerships, which means that private enterprises can only play a participatory role in the process.
According to Shaba, the items that NASRDA has developed are going to be put on the market as part of Nigeria's medium-term aims.
We will try to get out to them by phone and let them know. For instance, if the price of the data is intended to be 30 million, we offer it to customers for 25 million. You then sell it and profit from the sale. And after that, you give the remaining funds back to the organization."
This information was gathered from the several satellites that are available in Nigeria.
Shaba also cited the spin-offs that resulted from the company's Quick Win projects, which concentrated on specific problems such as food security, human security, disaster management, climate change, data management, and instructional software packages in space science.
Among these studies was one in which Wistar rats were subjected to high-frequency radiation to determine its effects. An investigation designed to assist the Agency in determining the latter on human subjects. Despite the fact that it is not entirely clear what fresh insights this research brings to the table, it does appear to be a well-researched topic. However, it goes without saying that science will always be intriguing.
In the year 2020, there were 23 initiatives classified as Quick Wins.

In a country that is deeply impacted by recession and that faces continuing insecurity, the majority of Nigerians view a space program as vanity metrics or showboating, depending on how you want to phrase it. But space technology is highly crucial.
According to Statista, the global space economy produced around $446.9 billion in the year 2020, which was an increase from $428 billion in the year prior. Commercial space products and services accounted for almost half of the total turnover in the sector.
However, the effects are not limited to those on the economy; they also have repercussions in other areas, including as agriculture, medicine, transportation, the environment, and communications.
NASRDA has collaborated with Nigerian and foreign military agencies throughout the course of the past few years in an effort to eradicate insurgency in West African countries.
According to The Guardian, the Agency made use of the NigeriaSat-X to generate a 10-metre digital elevation simulation map of Sambisa Forest as well as a vegetation density map in order to assist the military in its fight against the insurgency.
The NASRDA generated a digital depiction of the forest by essentially making use of the data that was collected from the satellite.
During the Malian civil war that took place in 2012 between Southern and Northern factions, NASRDA provided assistance to the Malian government.
In addition to this, the media organization claims that "the space agency contributed over 4000 satellite photos estimated to be worth $8.3 million to Nigerian universities and research organizations, using NigeriaSat-1 alone." Over the course of its first nine years in orbit, the NigeriaSat-1 satellite made direct contributions to the economy of Nigeria totaling more than 10.5 billion ($29 million).
These efforts were also carried on with the assistance of more recent satellites, such as the NigeriaSat-2 and the NigeriaSat-X.
In 2015, NIGCOMSAT was awarded the contract to administer the satellite known as BelinterSat-1, which belongs to Belarus. It is anticipated that this particular revenue source will bring in a total of $400,000 per year.
Taking all of these into consideration, along with the Quick Win projects and a number of other spin-offs, it would appear that the Agency has not been an absolute failure.
Nevertheless, despite the fact that Shaba describes the Nigerian space ecosystem as "vibrant," the country is still falling behind, and he attributes this problem to a lack of funding.

In the course of our conversation, Henry Ibitolu, who had previously worked as a Research Intern at NASRDA, made a very interesting parallel with India.
" At this very moment, India is very close to joining the league of countries that launch rockets. It cost $2 billion for the United States government, acting through NASA, to launch rockets toward Mars. However, India paid twenty million dollars to land a rover on Mars by utilizing the technology and manpower available in the country. That amounts to about ten percent or less of what the United States spent."
I would examine the stats later on, and although they are not exact, the numbers nevertheless say a lot about the situation. India's first attempt was successful, despite the country's expenditure of $73 million.
To be fair, India's space mission was finished in 2013, while the United States' first successful landing on Mars occurred in 1975; various things made it much cheaper, especially when compared to past standards.
India took care to collaborate with only domestic firms and experts in the field, and it made a number of alterations to the technology in order to improve its effectiveness. A place that can be reached thanks to an educational system that places a premium on courses in the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics).
There are just two universities in Nigeria that offer degrees in aerospace and aeronautical engineering: Kwara State University in Malete, Kwara State, and most recently, Lagos State University in Lagos. These universities are located in Kwara State.
I was also only able to find one university, FUTA, that offers remote sensing and GIS as a separate course from geomatics and surveying. This course is offered at FUTA. A Master of Science in Remote Sensing is also offered by a number of universities.
Ibitolu suggested that the government should put more money into education in the STEM fields.
As an illustration, the government ought to collaborate with educational institutions in order to generate original concepts. We have homegrown technology that we are able to capitalize on so that we can use that."
A viewpoint that is held by Oniosun.
The seven NASRDA research centers are all housed within universities, which is an interesting fact.
However, education is the primary source of funding. The space business requires a significant amount of finance. I mean, we just discussed India's plans to land a probe on Mars, which will cost 74 million dollars.
14.4 percent of the total budget allocation for the Ministry of Science and Technology was allocated to NASRDA in 2021, which resulted in the organization and its parastatals receiving 22.8 billion ($55.6 million).
The overall budgetary allotment for Nigeria's space program was 35.7 billion ($86.8 million), of which NASRDA was responsible for 64 percent, NIGCOMSAT was responsible for 22 percent, and DSA was responsible for 14 percent.
To put everything into perspective, if we consider the current fixation that the world has on Mars and compare it to the projected cost of NASA's current Mars mission, which is called Perseverance and is expected to cost $2.7 billion, then the total budget that Nigeria allocates to space exploration is barely more than 2 percent of the total cost.
A satellite, the construction of which can range in price anywhere from $400,000 to $1 million, is one option that comes to mind.
The only conclusion that can be drawn from this is that Nigeria's space program receives a very inadequate amount of funding.

In spite of the fact that there is no foolproof answer to this problem, Nigeria's best shot at success is the space economic model it has developed, more specifically the long-term strategy. A public-private partnership is an arrangement in which the government collaborates with businesses that are privately held.
But Ibitolu suggests that the NASRDA should focus on fulfilling its goal of sending a human being into space before taking on a more regulatory role.
It is required that you have served as a model for others before you can become a regulating agency. You need to put in the work yourself before you can instruct other people how to proceed. But you can't possibly expect people to follow your advice if you haven't even tried it themselves and you're telling them to do it. Simply because you have no idea."
A situation that is similar to the difficulties that face new businesses today in Nigeria.
Using the example of NASA and Space X, Oniosun believes that NASRDA should collaborate with universities and private businesses in order to support local startup businesses.
At some point, NASA and the United States government were forced to put their faith in SpaceX's ability to innovate and accomplish remarkable things. Perhaps Nigeria is going to have to do that.
" Although the Space Agency has educated hundreds of people to the level of masters and doctorates, this accomplishment is meaningless. Since it has never produced any results in the past, perhaps they should reconsider squandering their money on it.
" Instead of the Agency trying to accomplish all of that on its own, it could begin to outsource its technology and put its faith in the companies that are already doing it.
What exactly does it look like for a private business to operate in Nigeria?
According to Ibitolu, the downstream sector is expanding, and there are various companies in the space that specialize in GIS and remote sensing. But as of right now, there isn't a single private enterprise operating in the upstream sector.
Because there is still a lot of competition for available funds, this is a problem that could possibly also be ascribed to the capital intensive character of the industry. And Olayinka Fagbemiro, Assistant Chief Scientific Officer at NASRDA, feels that banks, most notably the African Development Bank (AfDB), could be the solution; however, there must first be confidence.
This is a facet of the private sector that the government needs to focus on, and it's something that's been said: Why? There must be conditions that are conducive to achievement. In order for folks to be able to commit the massive, enormous resources that need to go into the private sector and be a player in the space program, there has to be a certain ease of doing business in that aspect. This ease of doing business is what we mean by "ease of doing business."
" If banks, for example, can provide some form of loans for companies in the space sector, there are a lot of smart, young Nigerians coming up daily with competence; nevertheless, the most significant obstacle is finance. " Because of this, Africa is missing out on a significant number of opportunities, despite the fact that the continent stands to benefit greatly from the sale of space-based goods.
However, the investment or loan strategy would need to be structured for the long term. On the other hand, Shaba criticizes the Nigerian investors' pursuit of a rapid profit.

After Shaba's appointment as the new Director-General of NASRDA in May 2021, I questioned him about what to anticipate from the organization during his tenure as Director-General. The solutions proposed by Shaba include a significant amount of organizational reorganization, the addition of additional satellites, and compliance with government directives.
Ibitolu anticipates there will be some shifts.
We are optimistic that the new administration will bring about the kinds of changes we need. During the administration that before the current one, when I was working in information technology for NASRDA, I observed that those who had knowledge of Yoruba were given jobs. However, we are keeping our fingers crossed that NASRDA may surprise us with some new advancements.
A point of view that is shared by Fagbemiro.
Before I started writing this, I wanted to find out if the Space Agency has been delinquent in any of its responsibilities. In light of what I've learned, I've come to the realization that, although it certainly cannot be seen as an outright failure in comparison to other space programs, neither can it be regarded as an unqualified triumph, either.
But there is room for improvement. What say ye?
May 1999 marked the beginning of operations for the Nigerian Space Agency. 22 years, six spacecraft, and a number of Directors-General later, what can we say? Failure? Success? Both? Because Ogheneruemu Oneyibo done some research, we could now have some answers to our questions.
