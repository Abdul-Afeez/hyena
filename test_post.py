The year was packed with accounts of people\\'s achievements, setbacks, and subsequent growth. The following is a list of 22 <strong>things</strong> that have never before occurred in the ecosystem of technology found in Africa this year.</p><li>Coding was introduced as a subject in Kenyan schools, making it the first country in Africa to do so.</li><p>Uhuru Kenyatta, a former president of Kenya, made the announcement in August that computer programming would be added as a topic to the curriculum of both primary and secondary schools in the country. Because computer programming encourages youngsters to try new <strong>things</strong> and helps them feel comfortable expressing their creativity, this announcement was met with a positive response. It is also considered as a measure to ensure that Kenya continues to keep its status as one of the hotbeds for digital innovation on the continent. This view is supported by the fact that this initiative has received widespread attention.</p><p>An announcement to the same effect was made earlier in the year by the Department of Education of South Africa concerning the introduction of coding and robotics into schools.</p><li>There are currently startup acts in Nigeria and the DRC Congo.</li><p>Regulation is widely seen across Africa as an indispensable instrument that must be utilized in order to encourage innovation. As a result, there has been a growing call for the establishment of startup acts that would provide regulatory support for the technology sector. A legal and administrative framework supporting the development of new businesses within a nation is referred to as a \"startup act.\" It contributes to the creation of an atmosphere that supports the establishment, growth, and operation of startups inside a country.</p><p>Following Tunisia\\'s historic bill, which was enacted in April 2018, Senegal became the second African nation in December 2019 to establish a national startup legislation. Senegal\\'s law was modeled after the law that Tunisia passed in April 2018. This year, Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo were added to the list of African nations that have startup legislation.</p><p>Over ten nations on the African continent, such as Kenya, Rwanda, Ghana, and Ethiopia, are still working on the formulation of legislation pertaining to new businesses.</p><li>The Central African Republic is the first country in Africa to recognize bitcoin as a legitimate form of currency.</li><p>Bitcoin\\'s notoriety and use have grown exponentially around the globe over the past decade, with global use having increased by 2,300% since 2019 and 103 countries now permitting cryptocurrency trade. (Governments and regulatory agencies all over the world are still discussing whether or not it is safe.)</p><p>The Central African Republic (CAR) made the use of bitcoin as legal tender in April, making it the first country in Africa to do so and the second country in the world to do so after El Salvador. This necessitates the acceptance of bitcoin as a form of payment in addition to the Central African Central African CFA franc.</p><p>In a declaration made in October under the Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services (FAIS) Act, South Africa\\'s Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) declared that assets denominated in cryptocurrencies are to be categorized as financial products. This classification makes it possible for cryptocurrencies to be subject to regulation.</p><p>In comparison to the majority of African nations, which have either outright prohibited cryptocurrency or severely restricted its use, these two African nations stand out as exceptions. Four nations on the African continent, including Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia, have outlawed all types of cryptocurrency trading, while seven other countries on the continent, including Nigeria, Cameroon, and Gabon, have some form of cryptocurrency trading prohibition. These nations have claimed a variety of concerns as the basis for the restrictions, including tax evasion, money laundering, fraud, and financing of terrorist organizations.</p><li>A huge swath of people losing their jobs.</li><p>This year, African startup employees were not spared from witnessing layoffs, which are a regular occurrence during an economic downturn and are unfortunately rather widespread.</p><p>Since the beginning of COVID-19, a total of 246,267 individuals have been let go from their jobs at 1,495 different technology companies, according to statistics obtained from layoffs.fyi, a crowdsourced database of tech layoffs. Over 50,000 of these layoffs took place in 2022, and at least 1,000 technology professionals in Africa were terminated from their jobs.</p><p>The Egyptian mobility startup Swvl was the first company to initiate the layoffs in May, and it affected approximately 400 employees. Many new businesses, including Twiga Foods, Quidax, Vendease, 54 Gene, and Sendy, as well as many more, implemented a process that was functionally identical and blamed it on the current state of the economy.</p><li>Companies specializing in financial technology from Nigeria faced allegations of fraud in Kenya.</li><p>Because of claims of card fraud and international money laundering, Nigerian start-ups were being investigated by government agencies in Kenya, specifically the Central Bank of Kenya and its Asset Recovery Agency (ARA).</p><p>All of the following businesses and an individual named Simon Ngige have been implicated in a money laundering scheme: Flutterwave Payment Technology Limited, Boxtrip Travel and Tours Limited, Bagtrip Travel Limited, Elivalat Fintech Limited, Adguru Technology Limited, Hupesi Solutions, Cruz Ride Auto Limited, and Korapay.</p><p>These allegations of fraudulent activity have been dropped against a few of these <strong>fintech</strong> companies, including Flutterwave, Kora Pay, and Kandon, among others.</p><li>Over $4 billion was obtained through funding from venture capital.</li><p>The actual sum of money that African entrepreneurs were able to raise in 2022 is not yet known, but all indications suggest that it was very close to the amount that was raised in 2021. According to the Big Deal, more than four billion dollars have been collected so far in 2022.</p><p>This year did not see the birth of a new unicorn, but there were a number of <strong>noteworthy</strong> investment deals that took place. Algerian Yassir raised $150 million Series B; Nigerian Fintech TeamApt raised $50 million; and Congo-based crypto startup Jambo raised $37.5 million cumulatively this year. Ramani, a Tanzanian startup, raised a $32 million Series A, making it the largest Series A ever raised from the country. Wasoko (formerly Sokowatch), closed a $125 million Series B at a $625 million valuation. Algerian Yassir raised $150 million Series B. Wasoko (formerly Soko</p><li>The Metaverse was embraced by African corporations.</li><p>Over the course of the past year, <strong>interest</strong> in the Metaverse has skyrocketed, and numerous businesses have begun exploring its potential by filing patents related to related technologies or conducting related experiments.</p><p>After undergoing a rebranding in February, Africa\\'s largest telecommunications firm, MTN, became the first African corporation to purchase digital land in the Africarare metaverse Ubuntuland by purchasing 144 plots of land for an amount that has not been published. In the latter part of the year, Nedbank as well as the South African retail chain Game followed suit.</p><li>The fifth-generation cellular network (5G) is here to stay, and more African nations will soon have access to it.</li><p>For a very long time, 5G has been hailed as the technology that will revolutionize the networking landscape. Some analysts anticipate that 5G will contribute an additional $2.2 trillion to the economy of Africa by the year 2034. As a result of this, many African nations, including Gabon, will begin 5G testing in the next years, although only a select handful have yet to introduce the technology on a commercial scale. This is largely attributable to difficulties surrounding the clarity of spectrum legislation, the commercial sustainability of the solution, and the implementation timelines.</p><p>MTN began offering its 5G services to customers in Nigeria and Zambia during the fourth quarter of this year. Orange has also begun offering 5G service in Botswana. As the continent struggles with limited citizen purchasing power of 5G-enabled handsets and pricey internet, these commercial debuts represent a positive step forward.</p><li>offices have been established in Africa by multinational technology businesses.</li><p>When it comes to an organization\\'s dedication to a country, having a physical presence speaks volumes. This year saw a number of international technology companies establish their initial locations on the African continent.</p><p>Microsoft officially launched its new African Development Centre in Ikoyi, Lagos, in the month of March. The multi-billion dollar company has made an investment of one hundred million dollars in the center, which will serve as the location from where software engineering solutions will be offered to African countries.</p><p>In April, Google announced that it would be opening its first development center on the African continent in Nairobi. It is hoped that the center would contribute to the development of <strong>transformative</strong> goods and services for people living in Africa.</p><p>In April, Visa established its first innovation studio on the African continent in the country of Kenya. This facility will service the sub-Saharan Africa region and is the latest addition to a network of innovation centers that Visa has been operating since 2016, in places such as London, Dubai, and Singapore. The Nairobi studio is the sixth one in the world and the first one in Africa.</p><p>Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, and Tunisia are the seven countries in Africa where Bolt now has operations. In July, Bolt established its first African headquarters in Nairobi, which serves as a regional hub for those seven nations.</p><li>After an absence of five years, the Techstars Accelerator program returned to Africa.</li><p>Techstars made the announcement in April that it would be launching the ARM Labs Lagos Techstars Accelerator Programme. This program will provide assistance to <strong>fintech</strong> and proptech firms that are developing solutions for an African audience.</p><p>The statement marked the end of a sabbatical that the accelerator, which had more than half a billion dollars in assets under management (AUM), had taken in Africa for the previous five years. In the past, Techstars has operated an accelerator program in South Africa in partnership with Barclays Bank from 2016 to 2017. During that time period, they made investments in a total of 21 different startups, of which three have since been acquired, five have ceased operations, and 13 are still operational.</p><li>Swvl made history by becoming the first African company to get listed through SPAC.</li><p>In April, Egypt-born and Dubai-based mobility startup Swvl merged with Queen\\'s Gambit Growth Capital at a valuation of $1.5 billion, becoming the first African startup to go public via a special purpose acquisition company. Swvl was founded in Egypt, and the company now has its headquarters in Dubai ( SPAC).</p><p>However, ever since Swvl became publicly traded, the company\\'s price has plummeted, and the fledgling business is currently worth less than $40 million.</p><li>The competition for data centers and cloud space in Africa continues.</li><p>Oracle, the largest database management firm in the world, launched its <strong>first cloud region</strong> in Africa at the beginning of this year. A cloud region is essentially a cluster of data centers. In the latter part of the year, several international cloud and database service providers followed following.</p><p>In October, Google announced its desire to make South Africa the <strong>site</strong> of the first Google Cloud data center to be established on the African continent. Amazon Web Services (AWS) established its <strong>first office</strong> in Lagos, Nigeria, in the month of November. This comes five years after the company built its <strong>first location</strong> in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 2017. After successfully expanding to Zambia in August, Liquid Intelligent Technologies decided to take their business to the next level and commence operations in Nigeria in December.</p><li>Amazon Prime Video got more pronounced in Nigeria</li><p>This year, Amazon Prime Video made a <strong>concerted effort</strong> to increase its <strong>marketing efforts</strong> and provided Nigerian customers with the option to pay for the service using the country\\'s national currency, the naira. Amazon Prime Video has been methodically increasing the amount of Nigerian content it provides over the past few years. Prime Video was previously inaccessible to Nigerians, and anyone who wanted to watch it had to utilize a virtual private network (VPN).</p><p>In January, the business entered into an exclusive multi-year license agreement with Anthill Studios, a film production firm based in Lagos that is responsible for a number of critically acclaimed films such as Elevator Baby and Day of Destiny. A comparable agreement was finalized with Inkblot Studios, the company that was responsible for producing the films in the The Wedding Party franchise, exactly one year ago.</p><p>Amazon Prime Video gave the Nollywood production company Nemsia Films, which is responsible for films such as \"God Calling\" (2018) and \"Journey of an African Colony\" (2019), a commission in June to produce three movies.</p><p>It was recently claimed that Flavour, a Nigerian Highlife musician, has secured an exclusive deal with the streaming for the release of a biography.</p><p>Amazon Prime Video has officially entered the battle for video-on-demand (VOD) streaming dominance in Africa with these efforts.</p><li>The video streaming service offered by Vodacom was discontinued.</li><p>The introduction of new players into the African VOD scene also results in the departure of some of the previous players. The video streaming service known as Video Play, which was introduced by Vodacom in August of 2015, was discontinued in July of 2022.</p><p>Just on the Google Play Store alone, the service had more than one million downloads before it was made available for free recently. In 2019, the firm was successful in acquiring the rights to live-stream the English FA Cup on the service. In 2020, the company will also be successful in acquiring the rights to broadcast the content produced by the American film production studio company Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM).</p><p>As the level of competition in the market for on-demand content streaming continues to rise, this streaming service will be cancelled, joining a long line of South African streaming services that have been discontinued by mobile network operators.</p><li>Internet connectivity provided by Google\\'s Africa cable has arrived in Africa.</li><p>In 2022, the Equiano cable, a subsea <strong>internet</strong> connection that runs from Portugal to South Africa, was finally able to reach Africa. The cable crosses Togo, Nigeria, Namibia, and South Africa before terminating in South Africa. It is anticipated that it will start functioning sometime this month.</p><p>This initiative marks a significant milestone in Google\\'s ambition to deliver inexpensive <strong>internet</strong> access in Africa by constructing global infrastructure to assist in bringing faster <strong>internet</strong> to more people at lower connectivity costs. Google\\'s plan is to do this by establishing projects like this one.</p><p>The project, which is named after Olaudah Equiano, a writer and abolitionist who was born in Nigeria, is anticipated to help support further digital transformation on the continent and accelerate economic growth. The GDPs of Nigeria and South Africa are anticipated to rise by $10.1 billion and $7 billion respectively, while the GDP in Namibia is anticipated to rise by $260 million.</p><p>In a matter of close relevance to this, Elon Musk\\'s Starlink was granted permission to offer <strong>internet</strong> service in the countries of Nigeria and Mozambique.</p><li>2Africa is supported by Meta. Internet accessed through subsea cables has arrived in Africa</li><p>When finished, the undersea <strong>internet</strong> cable known as 2Africa Pearls will have a total length of 45,000 kilometers and will have connected 33 different places in a total of 46 different countries across Africa, Europe, and Asia. The cable arrived in Cape Town in the month of December. The objective of the 2Africa initiative is to provide <strong>internet</strong> connectivity throughout Africa.</p><p>The 2Africa project was initiated by Meta in May of 2020, and it is being carried out in conjunction with China Mobile, MTN, Orange, and Vodafone. The 2Africa cable, in contrast to the Equiano cable, will eventually cover the entirety of the African continent. The <strong>first section</strong> of the system is expected to become operational in the following year.</p><li>Meta has discreetly ended its initiative to provide low-cost <strong>internet</strong> access across Africa.</li><p>Express Wi-Fi, a program meant to deliver low-cost <strong>internet</strong> in developing nations through partnerships with local communities, mobile carriers, and companies, was discontinued by Meta after more than five years of operation of the initiative. Express Wi-Fi had been in operation. Several African nations, including Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Côte d\\'Ivoire, Zambia, Cameroon, Ghana, Zimbabwe, Madagascar, South Africa, and Uganda, were among those who successfully implemented the Express Wi-Fi initiative.</p><li>Controversies and problems relating to workplace cultures</li><p>In 2022, the thriving African tech industry was rocked by a number of scandals in addition to layoffs and the general economic downturn.</p><p>In 2018, several chief executive officers of <strong>internet</strong> startups faced allegations of unethical behavior.</p><p>The purportedly toxic behavior of Ebunoluwa Okunbanjo, CEO of Bento Africa, was brought to light in March 2022 after a series of interviews with former and current employees of the company. In light of these findings, the board of directors of the company instructed Okunbanjo to take a leave of absence from the company for a period of a few months. Later on, he was able to regain his position as CEO of the corporation.</p><p>Olugbenga Agboola, the Chief Executive Officer of Flutterwave, was the subject of a number of allegations in the month of April, based on various revelations. These charges ranged from harassment to insider trading. Flutterwave has responded by stating that these charges are false. A number of other prominent firms, such as Egyptian B2B e-commerce Capiter, Kloud Commerce, Risevest, and Healthlane, have also been involved in scandals.</p><li>A spate of mergers and purchases</li><p>This year there has been an increase in the number of merger and acquisition deals that have taken place across the continent. TechCabal recorded 26 acquisitions within the first half of 2022, while we recorded 17 during the <strong>third quarter</strong> of that same year. A few examples of these acquisitions are as follows:</p><p>Accra, Ghana-based B2B marketplace TradeDepot\\'s acquisition of GreenLion; Silvertree\\'s $12.3 million acquisition of Ucook, a meal kit delivery firm located in South Africa; Nigerian home concierge startup Eden life acquired Kenyan-based Lynk; UK-based power company Bboxx acquired West Africa-based solar energy provider Peg; Moroccan B2B e-commerce Chari acquired Ivorian B2B e-commerce startup Diago; and mPharma acquired a majority stake in HealthPlus.

Its primary objective is to entice technology firms and workers from all over Africa and the world. Zanzibar is offering work permits to relocated tech employees in order to entice tech businesses to set up shop there. This is something that has proven difficult to accomplish in mature countries such as Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt, and South Africa.</p><p>In addition, companies operating within the Zanzibar Free Economic Zone are immune from paying corporate taxes for a period of ten years.</p><li>MTN is leaving the Middle East market.</li><p>MTN Group, the largest wireless provider in Africa, made the announcement in November that it had sold its Afghanistan business to M1 New Ventures, located in Beirut, for the price of $35 million as part of its ongoing effort to diminish its presence outside of the continent.</p><p>This move is consistent with MTN\\'s strategic aim, which it has had since 2020, of concentrating more of its attention on the continent it calls home. Earlier, the company decided to pull out of its business in Syria and handed over its operations in Yemen to a joint venture partner. MTN has not abandoned its operations in Iran.</p>",
