This has resulted in an increase in the number of <strong>investments</strong> and partnerships with leading global brands, investors, and <strong>accelerators</strong> on a year-on-year basis. The continent's total funding inflow reached its all-time high of $5 billion in the previous year, during which time it also gave birth to five unicorn companies: Flutterwave, Andela, Chipper Cash, Opay, and Wave.</p><p>The accomplishment of such a difficult task demonstrated to the rest of the world that the technological ecosystem in Africa should not be disregarded. As a direct result of this, a greater number of accelerators, incubators, and global investors have established themselves on the continent, with the colossal global <strong>accelerator</strong> Techstars establishing its headquarters in Lagos, Nigeria. <a class=\"read-more\" href=\"https://www.techstars.com/newsroom/techstars-launches-arm-labs-techstars-accelerator-in-lagos\">setting up shop</a></p><p>The influx of <strong>investments</strong> has followed particular trends, with the dominance of the fintech sector being the most obvious of these trends. As <strong>local investments</strong> continue to increase, spurred by global optimism in Africa\u2014a continent projected to have the second-largest population in the world by 2050\u2014the inflow of <strong>investments</strong> has followed these trends. During the previous year, approximately <a class=\"read-more\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/08/reports-say-african-startups-raised-record-smashing-4-3b-to-5b-in-2021/?utm_source=Newsletter&utm_medium=TC_Daily&utm_campaign=next_wave_african_investors_love_fintech_but_theres_an_opportunity_cost&utm_term=2022-08-07#:~:text=That%20number%20doubled%20to%2062%25.\">62% of venture capital</a> was invested in fintech startups. The pattern continued in 2022, with approximately 60 percent of all venture capital <strong>investments</strong> being made in fintech companies during the first half of the year. Confirming the preference that African investors already had for the financial technology sector, fifty percent of the startups that were accepted into the summer batch of Y Combinator were financial technology players. <a class=\"read-more\" href=\"https://magnitt.com/research/Africa-h1-2022-venture-investment-report-50830?utm_source=Newsletter&utm_medium=TC_Daily&utm_campaign=next_wave_african_investors_love_fintech_but_theres_an_opportunity_cost&utm_term=2022-08-07\">60% of venture capital investments</a> <a class=\"read-more\" href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/companies?batch=S22&regions=Africa\">50% of the startups</a></p><p>Why is the financial technology industry so popular among investors who focus on Africa? The argument that fintech helps to unlock innovation in other industries by making it possible to conduct easier online transactions and by creating novel business models is a popular one. This is true in a sense because people will typically make more purchases when it is easier for them to do so, and businesses can innovate their processes to provide increased levels of flexibility and an improved overall experience for their customers. <a class=\"read-more\" href=\"https://techvented.com/investors-love-fintech\">darling of Africa-focused investors</a></p><p>However, this argument does not take into account the money-doubling incentives that are typical of the <strong>investment</strong> landscape and the backing provided by venture capital in Africa. As a result, the opportunity cost of innovation that is partially driven by incentives is that we risk concretizing a method that serves Wall Street, leaving impact as a \"nice-to-have\" byproduct. This is because <strong>investments</strong> into technology command the tune of innovation on a global scale. <a class=\"read-more\" href=\"https://officechai.com/startups/chamath-palihapitiya-startup-investing-ponzi-scheme/?utm_source=Newsletter&utm_medium=TC_Daily&utm_campaign=next_wave_african_investors_love_fintech_but_theres_an_opportunity_cost&utm_term=2022-08-07#:~:text=Palihapitiya%20says%20the%20structure%20of%20the%20investing%20industry%20creates%20incentives%20which%20might%20not%20be%20aligned%20with%20the%20the%20best%20interests%20of%20entrepreneurs.\">driven partly by incentives</a></p><p>The most recent class of companies accepted into Techstars Toronto's <strong>accelerator</strong> demonstrates that the organization is shifting its focus away from the fintech craze and investing its resources in companies that are innovating at the fundamental level. Only two of the nine startups in the cohort have a play in the financial technology sector, and those are GIGXPad and <a class=\"read-more\" href=\"https://gloverapp.co/\">Glover</a>. The remaining businesses are active in a variety of other tech verticals, such as healthtech and edtech, and are establishing significant foundations in the sectors in which they operate. In response to this, Alisha Golden, an <strong>investment</strong> associate at Techstars Toronto, made the following statement: \"The approach we took for this seventh cohort was to look at what kinds of innovation will be the bedrock of further development in the future. In other words, rather than simply putting money behind a few jockeys in the hope that one of them will win in the fintech blue ocean, we asked ourselves, \"How can our <strong>investments</strong> lead the way for greater transformation and thus increase opportunities for <strong>investment</strong> into more African founders and companies?\" This led us to the conclusion that we needed to take a more strategic approach. \u2019\u201d</p><img src=\"https://x7d4c5z5.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/tc/2022/12/OBA_9076.jpg\"  /><div class='text-small d-inline image-source'><i>TechCabal</i></div>Techstars\u2019 <strong>investment</strong> associate, Alisha Golden, with Adebowale Banjo, CEO, Mycover.ai<p>Fintech may be the go-to for investors, but we must remind ourselves why the sector continues to flourish: traditional institutions and banks laid the groundwork and built the infrastructure that modern fintech companies are leveraging. Africa's technology ecosystem is still in its infancy, and while fintech may be the go-to for investors, we must remind ourselves why the sector continues to flourish. If Africa's technology ecosystem is going to mature beyond its infant stage, then this playbook needs to be replicated for a variety of other technology verticals, and this is where Techstars comes in to play.</p><p>\" It is wonderful to see how welcoming Techstars is to people from all walks of life. From my vantage point, the mission should be to highlight companies that are at the forefront of innovation. Therefore, it is irrelevant what sector you work in. \"As long as you're making an impact, giving first, and driving the same with tech, Techstars backs you,\" <a class=\"read-more\" href=\"https://ng.linkedin.com/in/seunalley\">Seun Alley</a>, the founder of <a class=\"read-more\" href=\"https://www.fezdelivery.co/\">Fez</a>Delivery, said in an interview with TechCabal regarding the <strong>investment</strong> model utilized by Techstars.</p><p>The Chief Executive Officer of Glover, <a class=\"read-more\" href=\"https://ng.linkedin.com/in/damilola-layode\">Damilola Layode</a>, stated in an interview with TechCabal that the <strong>accelerator</strong> assisted his company in determining a strategy for the current economic climate. He went on to say that the program had the \"feeling of an equal part collegiate approach as well as real-life learnings from mentors, facilitators, and the Techstars Toronto team.\" He went on to say that this approach was beneficial to Glover because it assisted the startup in developing solutions \"in response to market demands.\"</p><p>When asked about the most important things that Techstars taught the cohort, Layode mentioned the importance of staying in constant communication with customers and how to leverage the power of networks. He also mentioned how to leverage the power of networks. Alley was quoted as saying, \"The foundation and structure of your business matter, and that it's okay not to have everything figured out, but that if you're willing to learn and unlearn, then it's only a matter of time before things will fall into place.\"</p><p>In Africa, the portfolio of companies represented by Techstars Toronto includes 29 different businesses, some of which are Healthtracka, Treepz, Quidax, Glade, and AltSchool. Because they have such a strong presence in Africa, they are able to pattern-match based on the potential of the market, the founders, and the makeup of the founding team. According to the accelerator, the most recent group of companies\u2014despite the fact that they operate in a variety of industries\u2014have demonstrated commendable traction, and they have the potential to become the next major industry winners.</p><p>Nine African startups were among the twelve that participated in Techstars Toronto's Winter 22 <strong>accelerator</strong> program. The startups are eligible to receive funding of up to $120,000, which is comprised of $20,000 in exchange for six percent of the fully diluted capital stock of the startup and an optional <strong>investment</strong> of $100,000 in the form of a convertible note.</p><p>In addition to the financial investment, the <strong>accelerator</strong> offers other advantages, such as connections to over 10,000 founders, alumni, and mentors.
